## School Management Application

Welcome to the School Management Application, a comprehensive administrative tool built with Spring and PostgreSQL, aimed at efficiently managing student, teacher, and class records.

### _Project Overview_

The School Management Application is an admin-focused system designed to simplify the handling of educational data within a school setting.
The primary goal is to provide a robust platform for administrators to perform CRUD operations on students, teachers, and classes, while enabling the assignment of teachers to classes and students to classes.

### _Features_

* **Student Management:** Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on student records, managing their information efficiently.
* **Teacher Management:** Administer teacher details, enabling additions, updates, and removals of teacher profiles.
* **Class Management:** Handle classes within the school, managing class details and schedules.
* **Assignment Handling:** Establish relationships between teachers and classes, and students and classes, allowing for efficient assignment management.

### _Technologies Used_

* **Spring Boot:** Leveraged for creating the backend application, handling business logic and data operations.
* **PostgreSQL:** Utilized as the database management system for storing and managing school-related data.
* **JdbcTemplate:** Employed for interacting with the PostgreSQL database directly, managing SQL queries and operations.
